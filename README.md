## What is the WordPress Full Site Editor (FSE)? 🎨

The **Full Site Editor (FSE)** is a revolutionary feature in WordPress that introduces a completely new way of designing and customizing websites. Unlike the traditional WordPress Customizer, where only certain parts of a theme could be modified, **FSE allows users to edit every aspect of their website**—from headers and footers to sidebars and page layouts—using a **visual, block-based approach**.

This removes the need for custom coding or third-party page builders, giving users **full control over their website’s design**.

## 🔑 Key Features & Functionality of Full Site Editor

- Ensures a consistent and personalized website experience.

## 🆚 How FSE Differs from Traditional Website Editing

Before FSE, WordPress users had to rely on a mix of tools like:

- **Classic Editor**
- **Customizer**
- **Third-party page builders** (e.g., Elementor, Divi)

This was **fragmented** and required switching between settings to achieve the desired look. In contrast, **FSE provides a single, unified interface** for managing and designing websites.

Another key difference is **block-based themes**. Traditional WordPress themes relied on **PHP template files**, limiting customization. **FSE allows full visual editing**, eliminating the need for manual coding.
