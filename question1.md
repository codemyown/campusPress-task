## What is the WordPress Full Site Editor (FSE)?

The Full Site Editor (FSE) is a game-changing feature that enables users to fully customize their websites using a block-based approach. Unlike the traditional Customizer, where only specific areas were editable, FSE gives complete control over headers, footers, sidebars, templates, and layouts—all without coding.
